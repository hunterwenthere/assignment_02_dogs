    data
        in addition to the information provided in the file, associate each dog with a number of 3-5 pictures taken from the list of pictures (it's OK if the pictures do not represent the same dog).
        feel free to change the pet type arbitrarily for some pets.
    on index.html
        encode the data in the appropriate JavaScript format.
        write code that reads through the data and paginates it, displaying limited information (e.g., name, breed, gender, and age) of 6 pets at a time.
        link every dog to their specific detail.html page (e.g., detail.html?pet=12).
        create a next/previous button system that enables to refresh the page (e.g., index.html?page=3) and see the next/previous 6 pets.
    on detail.html
        read the data from JSON file (e.g., data.json), which you have to preliminarily create
        write code that displays the complete information for the selected dog (based on the pet index in the query string) and shows its pictures.
        create a back button that enables the user to go back to the index page.

  Rubric

  There are 10 total points available for this assignment. They are assigned/deducted as follows.

    +1 point: the index page works as expected.
    +1 point: the detail page works as expected.
    +1 point: the code on the index page contains systems for showing errors in case the user visits the index of a page that does not exist. 
    +1 point: the code on the detail page contains systems for showing errors in case the user visits the page of a pet that does not exist.
    +1 point: the website is published on GitHub.
    +1 point: the website is posted on GitHub pages.
    +1 point: the HTML code is properly formatted.
    +1 point: you include code for changing the title of the detail page based on the name of the pet.
    +2 points: the detail page shows an arbitrary number of pictures (not necessarily always 3) that depends on the number of pictures you assign to each pet.
    +1 point: the detail page shows a different background based on the gender of the pet. 
    +2 points: you modify the data, so some pets are not available for adoption, and you don't display them on the index page.  
    -5 points: the detail pages are hard-coded (i.e., information is not loaded dynamically).
    -5 points: the data is formatted incorrectly.
